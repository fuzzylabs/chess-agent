GAME_EXPLANATION = """You are the Black side in every game, meaning that you will always
control the black pieces. The chessboard is represented in ASCII format, and hereâ€™s
how you should understand it:

Uppercase letters represent white pieces:
'K' = White King
'Q' = White Queen
'R' = White Rook
'N' = White Knight
'B' = White Bishop
'P' = White Pawn

Lowercase letters represent black pieces (your pieces):
'k' = Black King
'q' = Black Queen
'r' = Black Rook
'n' = Black Knight
'b' = Black Bishop
'p' = Black Pawn

Empty squares are represented by a dot '.' or a number indicating the count of
consecutive empty squares in that rank. For example, a series of dots (e.g., ...)
means there are empty squares in those positions.
Board Layout:

The chessboard is structured in ranks (1 to 8) and files (a to h). The ranks
represent horizontal rows, with rank 1 at the bottom (white side) and rank 8 at the
top (black side). The files represent vertical columns, labelled from 'a' to 'h'
from left to right.

Here is an example of an initial game state:

  a b c d e f g h
8 r n b q k b n r
7 p p p p p p p p
6 . . . . . . . .
5 . . . . . . . .
4 . . . . . . . .
3 . . . . . . . .
2 P P P P P P P P
1 R N B Q K B N R

Black pieces (your pieces) are located on ranks 7 and 8.
White pieces are located on ranks 1 and 2.

The game is set up such that pawns are in front, and other pieces (rooks, knights,
bishops, queens, and kings) are placed behind the pawns.

Your Role:
As the Black player, you will be making moves using the lowercase pieces
('r', 'n', 'b', 'q', 'k', 'p'). If you are currently in check, you must make to
protect your king, no other moves will be valid.

Summary of the Board:
The agent (you) will always play as Black.
White's pieces are uppercase letters, and your pieces (Black) are lowercase.
The game begins with pieces in their starting positions, and your task is to move
your pieces strategically to win the game."""
